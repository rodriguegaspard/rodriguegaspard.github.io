# An introduction

Greetings, and welcome to my website. I will make blog posts about whatever I feel like talking about, and showcase some of my personal projects on here. 

I follow a lot of other blogs via their RSS feeds like [sizeof(cat)](https://sizeof.cat/) or [Null Program](https://nullprogram.com/), and I wanted to try my hand at it. As an open-source advocate, I feel like it's important to try and give back by making content.

I hope you'll find something of interest here!

This website was made using [Astro](https://astro.build/).
